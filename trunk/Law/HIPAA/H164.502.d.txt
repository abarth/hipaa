(d) Standard: Uses and disclosures of
de-identified protected health information.
    (1) Uses and disclosures to create de-identified
information. A covered entity may use protected
health information to create information that is not
individually identifiable health information or
disclose protected health information only to a
business associate for such purpose, whether or not
the de-identified information is to be used by the
covered entity.
    (2) Uses and disclosures of de-identified
information. Health information that meets the
standard and implementation specifications for
de-identification under §164.514(a) and (b) is
considered not to be individually identifiable health
information, i.e., de-identified. The requirements of
this subpart do not apply to information that has been
de-identified in accordance with the applicable
requirements of §164.514, provided that:
        (i) Disclosure of a code or other means of record
identification designed to enable coded or otherwise
de-identified information to be re-identified
constitutes disclosure of protected health information;
and
        (ii) If de-identified information is re-identified, a
covered entity may use or disclose such re-identified
information only as permitted or required by this
subpart.

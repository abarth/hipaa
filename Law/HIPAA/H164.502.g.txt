of another person has also been obtained; and the
minor has not requested that such person be treated as

acting in loco parentis, is not the personal

                (A) The individual has been or may be subjected
to domestic violence, abuse, or neglect by such
person; or
                (B) Treating such person as the personal
representative could endanger the individual; and
